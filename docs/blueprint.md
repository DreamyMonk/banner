## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal green (#30ab8e), reminiscent of creation, growth, and positive impact.
- Background color: Very light green (#E8F8F3) to maintain a clean and fresh aesthetic.
- Accent color: Darker forest green (#228B22), draws on nature-oriented connotations, while providing strong contrast against the background.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', sans-serif.
- Body font: 'Alegreya', serif. A sophisticated and elegant typeface choice that contrasts effectively with Belleza and improves readability for body text.
- Use clear, minimalist icons that represent different actions (upload, drag, send) using a consistent outline style.
- A clean, intuitive layout with drag-and-drop functionality. A clear division of sections (upload, compose, send) will guide users through the process.
- Subtle transitions and animations when dragging and placing elements, confirming actions, and sending emails to provide feedback and improve UX.
